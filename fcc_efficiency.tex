\section{Studies of signal and background separation in detector-level of cluster}
In the Future detector ,when energy of collision is upper, pileup is bigger, and the most important thing is separating signal and background efficiently. In this section, we want to study in different variables and see wether those can efficiently separate the signal and background in different detector size in detector-level of cluster.\\

Figure 3 to 5 show three variables about $c2b1$ , $\tau_{21}$, and $\tau_{32}$ in different energy of collision, the ROC curve of the different HCAL detector sizes. The criteria of separation efficiency is that in the different sizes of the detector, if the certain one of the detector size has the highest value of (1-background efficiency) at same signal efficiency of different detector sizes, it means its background efficiency is lowest, and we can say it has the highest separation efficiency compare with other detector sizes.\\

In Figure 3. we can see that $c2b1$ is the best variable to separate the signal and background, because all lines are higher than other two variables in same energy(Figure 4 and Figure 5). But in the different detector size of separation efficiency in this variable, we can't see more improvement in, as you can see, all lines nearly merge together in all energy, it means all detector sizes has the similar separation efficiency.\\

Figure 4 performs that $\tau_{21}$ at 5 TeV in smallest detector size(1$\times$1) can separate signal and background well. But higher than this energy, all lines nearly merge together, they have similar separation efficiency. In 20TeV and 40TeV, we can see that it doesn't improve the separation efficiency, specially, bigger detector size has the higher separation efficiency than smaller detector size in this two energy.\\

Figure 5 shows $\tau_{32}$ follows the role which smaller detector size have the bigger separation efficiency in all energy, and this one is what we want to see, because we want to use the smaller detector size to add the separation efficiency of the detector.\\

In summary, because the purpose of this study want to see which variable can separate the signal and background efficiently, and we can see that $c2b1$ and $\tau_{32}$ has the high value of the separation efficiency in high energy of collision,we think it can help the future high energy collider analysis.\\
